# Contributing to React Native Swipeable Card Stack

You are welcome to contribute to React Native Swipeable Card Stack. Here are some explanations.

## Project organisation

The project is a monorepo built with `yarn workspaces`. It has two workspaces:

- `react-native-swipeable-card-stack`: the library's code (under `/library`)
- `example-app`: a simple Expo app showcasing the different use cases of the library

## Running the example app

> ℹ️ All commands should be run from the root of the project.

Start by transpiling the library:

```shell
yarn serve
```

Then run the example app:

```shell
yarn start
```
